For the implementation of my Multi Media Project 1 in the second semester (working title: Backpackers - Find Secret Spots), the following programming languages ​​have been used: 
- PHP and Javascript/jQuery
- Markup-Language: HTML, the basic structure of the project
- Style language: CSS, which is responsible for the appearance of the HTML documents.

The project was split as follows:
- PHP files are responsible for accessing the database in the backend,
binding other PHP files for example: Header, Footer, Pin_Map, User_Map etc.
- JS files, for animations (Particles) and responsible for user interactions (such as the creation of the bucket list, setting the pins on the map, visibility of the imprint by mouse hover etc.)
- CSS file for the design of the HTML document
