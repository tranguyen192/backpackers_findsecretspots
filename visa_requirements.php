    <h2> to Southeast Asia </h2>
    <h4>last updated 6h April 2018</h4>

    <p>As a backpacker in Southeast Asia, crossing borders becomes a regular undertaking!
        Each country has a different rule of entry and some countries will require you to apply
        for a visa before you travel. As visa requirements often change, for travellers in South
        East Asia it can be difficult to plan things â€“ like budget and duration of travel. Here,
        weâ€™ve done our (very) best to compile the latest visa information in Southeast Asia to make
        it easier for you to plan your trip!

        Please be aware that information regarding visas is particularly vulnerable to change and be
        sure to get in touch with us or write an update in the comments below if you have new knowledge
        of a change in border crossing information!</p>

    <h3>Brunei Darussalam ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡³</h3>

    <p>The government of Brunei allows visa-free entry for 90 days for nationals of the following countries:
        All EU countries, Iceland, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway and the United States.

        Nationals of the following countries get 30 days visa-free:
        Malaysia, New Zealand, Oman, Singapore, South Korea, Turkey, Ukraine, UAE.

        Nationals of the following countries get only 14 days visa-free:
        Cambodia, Laos, Philippines, Canada, Macau, Thailand, Hong Kong, Maldives, Vietnam, Indonesia, Myanmar, Japan, Peru.

        Citizens of the above countries will receive an â€˜entry passâ€™ upon entering Brunei, which is stamped in your passport
        at the Immigration Checkpoint stating how many days you can stay in Brunei.

        Nationalities of the following countries can get a visa on arrival at Brunei International Airport:
        Australia, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, China, Taiwan, Kuwait.

        The cost of the visa on arrival is 20 Brunei Dollars (approx. $14.50 USD) for a single entry visa for 30 days
        or 30 Brunei Dollars (approx $22 USD) for a multiple entry visa for 30 days.

        72-hour transit visas are also available for most nationalities provided that the traveller can show a ticket
        for an onward destination.

        Entry and transit is refused to <b>nationals of Israel</b>.

        Passports must be valid for up to 6 months before entering and the embassy recommends that you travel with at
        least six unused pages in your passport.</p>

    <h3>Cambodia ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡­</h3>

    <p>Most nationalities are eligible for a 30-day tourist visa on arrival which costs $30 USD. (T Visa) Payments must
        be made in $USD.

        You must have two completely free pages in your passport, as well as 6-months validity. You must have two recent
        passport photos of yourself â€“ and take your own pen â€“ it avoids fights!

        Passport holders of ASEAN countries do not require a visa on arrival.

        eVisa: You can also apply for an eVisa before entering Cambodia which takes 1-3 days to process. If you google
        â€˜Cambodia eVisaâ€™, lots of adverts come up first in the search list, however, the official government website is:
        https://www.evisa.gov.kh/

        You will need to fill out an application form online and upload a digital photo.

        The eVisa is actually a bit more expensive than a normal visa on arrival at $37 USD ($30 USD for the visa,
        $7 USD processing fee and $3 USD credit card fee).

        <b>Advantages of an eVisa:</b> There are a few reasons why you may want to pay for an eVisa over a normal visa:
        1) Frequent travellers who do not want to waste a page in their passports. 2) You avoid the queues at airports
        or at borders where people are getting their visas on arrival. 3) In the past visa scams were rife. When visa
        fees were paid at Thai/Cambodia border crossings, officials demanded that fees be paid in THB with a poor
        exchange rate and/or rounded up considerably. Weâ€™re not sure if these scams are currently in operation, but the
        eVisa avoids this completely.

        <b>Disadvantages:</b> 1) You have to know your point of entry beforehand which can be difficult for free and easy
        backpackers. 2) You cannot use the eVisa at all border crossings. It is currently only available at Phnom Penh
        and Siem Reap International Airports, Cham Yeam/Koh Kong, Poipet/Banteay Meanchey and Bavet/Svay Rieng.

        <b>Visa extensions:</b> The normal 30-day tourist visa is a single entry, and once it runs out you can extend at an
        embassy for another 30 days for a fee of $45 USD. After that, you must leave the country and come back to get
        a new visa.</p>

    <h3>East Timor (Timor Leste) ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡±</h3>

    <p>In 2015, East Timor signed an agreement with the EU to allow all citizens of countries in the EU, that are
        contracting parties to the Schengen Agreement, to stay in East Timor without a visa for up to 90 days. This
        includes most European countries except Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Ireland, Romania and the UK. (Indonesian
        and Portuguese citizens also get 90-day free access).

        Nationals of other countries can apply for a Tourist or Business Visa on arrival at Dili International Airport
        or Dili Sea Port.  A single entry visa for 30 days costs $30 US Dollars. Transit visas for less than 72 hours
        are available for $20 USD. You must have the correct amount in US Dollars upon arrival.

        If you are arriving by land, you must apply in advance for a Visa Application Authorization at an East Timor
        Embassy. There are embassies in Jakarta, Denpasar in Bali and the closest one is in Kupang, which is the capital
        of the province East Nusa Tenggara (on the same island as Timor Leste). The mainland border crossing with
        Indonesia is at Motaâ€™ain, 115km west of Dili.

        For the application, you will need a copy of your passport, a passport photo and proof of funds in your bank
        account (rules say $150 / day for however long you want to stay in the country). Once you have your application
        form you will present this to the Immigration Official at the border who, if everything is in order, will grant
        you a 30-day visa for $30 USD.

        Your passport must be valid for 6 months, accommodation arrangements (at least at the beginning of your trip)
        and some officials may ask you for an onward ticket out of East Timor.

        If you are not able to access an East Timor Embassy, you can apply online via the
        <a href="http://www.migracao.gov.tl/">Immigration Service of Timor Leste </a>. You will need to download the
        <a href="http://www.migracao.gov.tl/html/sub0202.php"></a> application form here </a> and fill in the form using Adobe Acrobat Reader or
        by signing, scanning and emailing. The visa process can take up to 10 working days and must be used within 12
        months of being granted.

        See <a href="http://www.migracao.gov.tl/html/sub0301.php"></a> this page </a>for more info on business and tourist visas.</p>

    <h3>Indonesia ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡©</h3>

    <p>All EU citizens, US citizens and citizens of most nations can visit Indonesia without a visa for 30 days.
        This 30-day visa waiver entry cannot be extended or converted to any other type of visa.

        You can also get a visa on arrival at a cost of $35 USD for 30 days. The benefit of this visa is that you can
        extend it (once) for a maximum of 30 days by visiting an immigration office within Indonesia. So, if you think
        you may end up staying longer, this is the best visa to go for.

        How to extend your 30-day Tourist Visa in Indonesia: This can be done through a â€˜visa agentâ€™, who will take
        your passport to the Immigration Office and charge you anything from $50 -70 USD to do the whole process for
        you (we donâ€™t recommend it).

        If you want to extend your visa yourself, make sure you give yourself at least 7 days to complete the whole
        process (and avoid spontaneous public holidays).

        To extend your visa you will need to provide 2 copies of your passport, 2 copies of your visa page, your
        passport itself, 2 copies of your â€˜proof of onward journeyâ€™ which could be a plane ticket out of Indonesia
        to show them that you are leaving within 30 days of your extension and the name and address of where you are
        staying. Oh and take a black pen.

        You must have 2 blank pages in your passport and 6 months validity.</p>

    <h3>Laos ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡¦</h3>

    <p>Citizens of the following countries can enter Laos visa-free for a specified number of days:
        Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam (30 days), Japan, Luxembourg,
        Russia, South Korea, Switzerland (15 days), Brunei, Myanmar (14 days).

        Almost all other nationalities (apart from Pakistan, Sri Lanka, some African and Middle-Eastern nations) can
        obtain a visa on arrival for 30 days whether crossing by air or land.

        You will need at least 6 months validity left on your passport, at least 2 blank pages, 2 passport photos.

        The cost ranges from $20 â€“ $42, depending on your nationality. For example: Australia â€“ $30 USD. Canada â€“ $42 USD.
        China â€“ $20 USD. India â€“ $40 USD. Sweden â€“ $31 USD. USA â€“ $35 USD. UK â€“ $35 USD. Others â€“ $30 USD. For â€˜othersâ€™
        please contact a Laos Embassy to find out the exact price.

        You should have the correct amount in $US Dollars. Paying in Thai Baht or Cambodian Riel at the neighbouring countries
        borders can be more expensive as prices are often rounded up and poor exchange rates are given. We heard that a flat
        rate of 1500 THB ($50 USD) was recently given at some Thai/Laos borders.</p>

    <h3>Malaysia ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾</h3>

    <p>For citizens of most nations who visit Malaysia, the country has perhaps the easiest visa process in Southeast Asia.

        Malaysia has Malaysia grants a 14, 30 or 90-day visa-free entry to nationals of many countries across the world.
        This is known as a â€˜Social Visit Passâ€™.

        Nationals of certain countries are required to show an international certificate of vaccination against yellow fever.</p>

    <h3>Myanmar ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡²</h3>

    <p>Getting a visa to Myanmar used to be a lengthy process that could only be done in person at a Myanmar Embassy.
        Some people got rejected, particularly if they were journalists or writers of some sort. These days, however,
        it is now really easy for travellers to get a visa online via the official Myanmar eVisa website.

        Costs for the eVisa: Tourist visa for 28 days, $50 USD. Business visa for 70 days, $70 USD.

        All you have to do is fill out a form online, upload a digital photo and make the payment online with credit card.
        You can pay by Visa, MasterCard, Amex or JCB and the processing time is three days, although you can pay more if you
        would like a visa urgently.

        You will receive an approval letter by email, which you need to print out and bring with your passport to present
        to the officials upon arrival in Myanmar, who will stamp your letter and passport. The approval letter is valid
        for 90 days from the date it is issued. (More FAQs answered on the official government page here).

        Where can you use the eVisa? Until recently, you could not enter Myanmar overland with this eVisa, it could only
        be used when flying into Yangon, Mandalay or Naypyidaw Airports. However, since September 2016,  e-visas can be
        used to enter from the following Thailand/Myanmar land borders: Tachileik (Mae Sai), Myawaddy (Mae Sot) and
        Kawthaung (Ranong).</p>

    <h3>Philippines ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­</h3>

    <p>Nationals of Brazil and Israel are granted a visa free entry for 59 days upon arrival in the Philippines.
        Citizens of Macau and Hong Kong receive 14 days. Citizens of most other nationalities are granted 30 days,
        which includes all other EU citizens, the USA, Australia, Russia and all other South American countries.

        Onward ticket: When flying into the Philippines, the airline will ask you for â€˜proof of onward journeyâ€™ â€“
        this could be a return ticket or a ticket out of the Philippines to another country. Not all airlines will
        ask, but I do recommend that you book an onward ticket in the case that you are asked to avoid having to buy
        an airline ticket at the airport!

        Getting a Tourist Visa before you arrive: All of those citizens who are allowed the 30-day visa free entry
        can apply for a Tourist Visa before travelling to the Philippines which is valid for 59 days. You need to go
        to a Philippine Embassy to apply for the Tourist Visa and the cost is 22 GBP / 27 Euro / $32 USD.

        There is some information online to suggest that you can also apply for a longer tourist visa
        (3 months / 6 months / 12 months) but this information has not been officially published so please ask at the
        embassy when you apply.</p>

    <h3>Singapore ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¬</h3>

    <p>Citizens of most countries in the world can travel to Singapore without a visa, gaining 30-90 days upon entry
        depending on their nationality. To enter you must have 6 months validity on your passport, proof of onward
        ticket, sufficient funds to stay in Singapore and yellow fever vaccination if you have recently travelled to
        a country that has yellow fever. (You may or may not be asked for proof of some or all of the above when
        entering Singapore, it just depends on the Immigration Official â€“ but itâ€™s best to be prepared!)

        The following nationalities receive 90 days: All EU citizens, Australia, Norway, South Korea, Switzerland, USA.

        The following nationalities receive 30 days: All ASEAN nations, Canada, New Zealand, all South American nations,
        most African countries.</p>

    <h3>Thailand ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­</h3>

    <p>Most nationalities receive a Free Tourist Entry Pass upon arrival into Thailand by air or land.

        Citizens of five nations (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, South Korean) receive a 90-day visa-free entry into
        Thailand.

        Citizens of 51 nations (including the USA, UK and most EU nations) receive 30-day visa-free entry into Thailand.

        Citizens of Cambodia and Myanmar receive only 14 days.

        Getting a 60-day Tourist Visa before you travel: For those who know that they want to stay longer in Thailand,
        this is probably your best option. The cost for a 60-day Tourist Visa is $40 USD and you should apply for it,
        in person, at a Thai Embassy before you travel (at any Thai Embassy in any country that is not Thailand).

        As you do not need to apply for the Thai visa in your home country, if you enter Thailand on a 30-day free pass,
        you could always leave and travel to a neighbouring Asian country and get yourself a 60-day Tourist Visa to
        Thailand while youâ€™re there! (You can also extend this visa within Thailand)</p>

    <h3>Vietnam ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡³</h3>

    <p>Vietnam grants visa-free entry to a number of nationalities for a certain number of days:
        <ul>
            <li>
        90-Day Visa Free Entry: Citizens from Chile can enter Vietnam for 90 days without a visa.
            </li>
            <li>
        30-Day Visa Free Entry: Citizens of Cambodia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Laos and Kyrgyzstan can enter Vietnam for 30 days without a visa.
            </li>
        21-Day Visa Free Entry: Citizens of the Philippines get 21 days upon arrival in Vietnam.
            <li>
        15-Day Visa Free Entry: Granted to citizens of the UK, Norway, Russia, Belarus, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Japan, Italy, Germany, France, South Korea, Spain.
            </li>
        </ul>
        E-Visa: Should you wish to stay longer than your allocated time, you can apply for an eVisa in advance of your
    travels on the official Vietnam Portal of Immigration. The eVisa is valid for a maximum of 30 days, single entry.
    The cost is $25 USD.

    You can apply online for the eVisa online here. You will need to upload a copy of your passport and receive a
    registration code. After that, you pay the $25 USD fee by credit or debit card and wait for 3-days for the visa to
    be processed. Once you have your eVisa you should print out and bring it with you to show to the Immigration Officials
    upon entry to Vietnam.

    For longer tourist visas (90 days): It is possible to get a three-month single entry visa ($35 USD) or multiple-entry
    visa ($70 USD) to Vietnam if you apply at a Vietnamese Embassy before you travel. Or, if you cannot get to an embassy,
    there are many online agencies who can arrange this for you without sending your passport anywhere. Try <a href="https://vietnamvisacenter.org/"> Vietnam Visa Center</a>
    (as recommended in the LP, Lonely Planet).</p>
